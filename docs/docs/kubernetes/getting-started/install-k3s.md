# Install k3s

To install k3s I use [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup), which automates the process of sshing into the server and running the install script.

## Install kube tools on your local machine

:::warning

All packages need to be installed on your local machine.

:::

### `kubectl` and utilities

To operate the cluster, you need to install `kubectl`. I also use other tools like:

- `kubeseal` to encrypt secrets
- `kubectx` to switch between clusters
- `kustomize` to manage and patch Kubernetes objects
- `k9s` to have a terminal UI for Kubernetes
- `helm` to manage Kubernetes applications
- `flux` to manage GitOps

You can install all of them by running:

```bash
brew install kubectl kubeseal kubectx kustomize k9s helm fluxcd/tap/flux
```

### `k3sup`

Installing `k3sup` is easy. Just run the following command:

```bash
curl -sLS https://get.k3sup.dev | sh
sudo install k3sup /usr/local/bin/
```

## Install k3s

Install the k3s master node with:

```bash
k3sup install --ip <server ip> --user lorenzo --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 --local-path ~/.kube/config
```

`k3sup` will automatically copy the `kubeconfig` in the path you specify with `--local-path`. The default path for `kubectl` is `~/.kube/config`.

Now try to access the cluster with:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
NAME           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
k8s-master-1   Ready    control-plane,master   38h   v1.32.3+k3s1
```

Once you have the master node up and running, you can install the worker nodes with:

```bash
k3sup join --ip <worker ip> --server-ip <master ip> --user lorenzo --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

`k3sup` will automatically use the join token generated by the master node.

Now you should see all the worker nodes together with the master:

```bash
NAME           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
k8s-master-1   Ready    control-plane,master   38h   v1.32.3+k3s1
k8s-worker-1   Ready    <none>                 38h   v1.32.3+k3s1
k8s-worker-2   Ready    <none>                 38h   v1.32.3+k3s1
```
